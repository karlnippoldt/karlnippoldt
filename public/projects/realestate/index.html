The original version was functional, but old, and did not provide the best-in-class experience customers expect. For this project, my team worked with a leading mortgage data and analytics company through our senior capstone project class at UC Irvine.</p></div><div class="section"><h2>Deliverables</h2><p><strong>I created a new, modern design for this product using Figma.</strong> I implemented improved interfaces for existing features, added new features, including account settings and a dashboard, and created a library of components to ensure consistency throughout the interface. The new design was informed by the results of my team’s survey and previous interviews performed by the company. We also created a front-end implementation of our new design using Angular.</p></div><div class="section"><h2>Process</h2><p><strong>My team followed as close to a user-centered design process as we could,</strong> given the constraints of the project. We began by getting up to speed on the users—who they are and why they use the software—meeting with the product manager, the person at the company most familiar with them. We then evaluated our priorities in a redesign by conducting a survey and reviewing previous user interviews. From this information, I developed a clickable, high-fidelity mockup of a redesign of the system using Figma. Based on the mockup, we created a working prototype in Angular.</p></div><div class="section"><h2>My Role</h2><p><strong>My primary role in this project was closest to that of a UX designer.</strong> For this project, I was part of a team of six students. My team worked together on initial sketches; from there, I created both wireframes and the high-fidelity mockup. I was also one of two primary contacts between my team and the sponsoring company for our project, scheduling meetings and ensuring consistent communication between the two teams.</p></div><div class="section section-wide"><div class="row align-items-center"><div class="col-md image-margins text-center"><figure class="figure my-0"><a data-fancybox="lightbox_showcase" data-caption="Home screen" data-width="1280" href="/assets/images/projects/realestate/showcase_1.png"><img class="figure-img img-fluid img-thumbnail" src="/assets/images/projects/realestate/showcase_1.png" width="1280" alt=""></a><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Home screen</figcaption></figure></div><div class="col-md image-margins text-center"><figure class="figure my-0"><a data-fancybox="lightbox_showcase" data-caption="Search screen, geography filter" data-width="1280" href="/assets/images/projects/realestate/showcase_2.png"><img class="figure-img img-fluid img-thumbnail" src="/assets/images/projects/realestate/showcase_2.png" width="1280" alt=""></a><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Search screen, geography filter</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class="section text-center"><p><a class="btn btn-lg btn-secondary" href="#mockup">Skip to Mockup <span class="iconify" data-icon="feather:arrow-down"></span></a></p></div><div class="section-tall"><hr></div><div class="section-tall"><h1>Process</h1><div class="timeline-row"><div class="timeline-col"><a href="#research"><img src="/assets/images/projects/realestate/research.svg" alt=""><p>Research</p></a></div><div class="timeline-col"><a href="#personas"><img src="/assets/images/projects/realestate/personas.svg" alt=""><p>Personas</p></a></div><div class="timeline-col"><a href="#sketches"><img src="/assets/images/projects/realestate/sketches.svg" alt=""><p>Sketches and Wireframes</p></a></div><div class="timeline-col"><a href="#design"><img src="/assets/images/projects/realestate/design.svg" alt=""><p>Design</p></a></div><div class="timeline-col"><a href="#prototype"><img src="/assets/images/projects/realestate/prototype.svg" alt=""><p>Prototype</p></a></div></div><div class="section" id="research"><h2>Research</h2><div class="section image-margins-x text-center"><img class="illustration" src="/assets/images/projects/realestate/research.svg" alt="Illustration of house with magnifying glass"></div><p>We began our project by undertaking to understand the users of this product. My team’s prior exprience in the real estate industry was limited, so we devoted quite a bit of time to this task.</p><div class="lead"><p>Our goal was to understand the user’s journey, their goals when they open the software, and the steps they take to get there.</p></div><p>We started by talking with those at the company who were already familiar with the product’s users, such as the product manager. While the company wants to stay up to date with a more modern design for this product, users are resistant to change and a radical redesign would likely cause them to lose customers. However, users did desire some additional features not present in the original product. For example, the original system did not provide any way for them to manage their account. If the user forgot their password, they had to contact customer service to get it changed. This was both frustrating to users and a significant expense for the company.</p><div class="lead"><p>We created a 15-question survey to learn about the users and which features they value most.</p></div><p>We worked as a team to compile the questions, consulting with a UX designer at the company to ensure our questions were valuable and concise. From the final list of questions, I created the survey on Qualtrics.</p><div class="section text-center"><p><a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" href="/assets/pdf/projects/realestate/survey_questions.pdf" target="_blank">View survey questions <span class="iconify" data-icon="feather:external-link"></span></a></p></div><p>While we were not able send the survey directly to users, a link to complete the survey was shown to users when they opened the product.

Users preferred to interact with data outside the product instead of using its built-in visualization features, indicating a possible area for improvement. After the survey was completed, I created a document summarizing the data collected and how it would impact our project.</p><div class="section text-center"><p><a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" href="/assets/pdf/projects/realestate/survey_results.pdf" target="_blank">View survey results summary <span class="iconify" data-icon="feather:external-link"></span></a></p></div></div><div class="section" id="personas"><h2>Personas</h2><div class="section image-margins-x text-center"><img class="illustration" src="/assets/images/projects/realestate/personas.svg" alt="Illustration of a woman and a man next to each other"></div><div class="lead"><p>From the information we learned about the users from our research, we created personas and storyboards.</p></div><div class="section section-wide"><div class="row align-items-center"><div class="col-md image-margins text-center"><figure class="figure my-0"><a data-fancybox="lightbox_personas" data-caption="Persona for Mark San" data-width="1646" href="/assets/images/projects/realestate/persona_1.png"><img class="figure-img img-fluid img-thumbnail" src="/assets/images/projects/realestate/persona_1.png" width="1646" alt=""></a><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Persona for Mark San</figcaption></figure></div><div class="col-md image-margins text-center"><figure class="figure my-0"><a data-fancybox="lightbox_personas" data-caption="Persona for Stacy Rose" data-width="1646" href="/assets/images/projects/realestate/persona_2.png"><img class="figure-img img-fluid img-thumbnail" src="/assets/images/projects/realestate/persona_2.png" width="1646" alt=""></a><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Persona for Stacy Rose</figcaption></figure></div><div class="col-md image-margins text-center"><figure class="figure my-0"><a data-fancybox="lightbox_personas" data-caption="Persona for Jacob Williams" data-width="1646" href="/assets/images/projects/realestate/persona_3.png"><img class="figure-img img-fluid img-thumbnail" src="/assets/images/projects/realestate/persona_3.png" width="1646" alt=""></a><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Persona for Jacob Williams</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class="section section-wide"><div class="row align-items-center"><div class="col-md image-margins text-center"><figure class="figure my-0"><a data-fancybox="lightbox_personas" data-caption="Storyboard: Stacy retrieves a saved search" data-width="1999" href="/assets/images/projects/realestate/storyboard_1.png"><img class="figure-img img-fluid img-thumbnail" src="/assets/images/projects/realestate/storyboard_1.png" width="1999" alt=""></a><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Storyboard: Stacy retrieves a saved search</figcaption></figure></div><div class="col-md image-margins text-center"><figure class="figure my-0"><a data-fancybox="lightbox_personas" data-caption="Storyboard: Mark creates a new custom search" data-width="1999" href="/assets/images/projects/realestate/storyboard_2.png"><img class="figure-img img-fluid img-thumbnail" src="/assets/images/projects/realestate/storyboard_2.png" width="1999" alt=""></a><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Storyboard: Mark creates a new custom search</figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div class="section" id="sketches"><h2>Sketches and Wireframes</h2><div class="section image-margins-x text-center"><img class="illustration" src="/assets/images/projects/realestate/sketches.svg" alt="Illustration of a woman sketching user interface elements"></div><div class="lead"><p>My team began designing a new interface together, beginning with sketching designs on a whiteboard.</p></div><p>A particularly challenging design problem was creating a screen to refine the geography of a search.

For problems like this, each member of the team sketched different solutions to this problem. For our final design, we put together the best ideas from each of the sketches.

To move forward with the project, we used video recordings and screenshots of product demos as our primary source of information. While we were able to make significant progress despite not being able to use the product, we later encountered delays as we realized shortcomings in some of our designs and had to go back to the drawing board.</p></div><div class="section" id="design"><h2>Design</h2><div class="section image-margins-x text-center"><img class="illustration" src="/assets/images/projects/realestate/design.svg" alt="Illustration of a canvas with sketches next to a tablet computer"></div><div class="lead"><p>Using the company styles available to me, I created high-fidelity designs in Figma.</p></div><p>First, I created the styles and components (such as buttons and cards) to use on the mockup, ensuring consistency across different screens.

Throughout the project, I also consulted with a UX designer at the company, who provided valuable feedback, particularly on information architecture and visual design conventions.</p><div class="lead"><p>Based on the feedback we received, I updated the design of the mockup to better fit user needs.</p></div><p>I toned down the colors in the initial design for a more conservative, businesslike look, leaving the red accent color for buttons and headings to match the company’s branding.
