A significant portion of the stress of a trip to the airport is the result of unfamiliarity and uncertainty. Is the flight delayed? When should I get to the airport? Where should I go once I get there?</p></div><div class="section"><h2>Deliverables</h2><p><strong>My project provides the driver with helpful information</strong> that reduces the unknowns of a trip to the airport, making the pick-up experience less stressful. I created a design using Figma that adds features to the existing Southwest Airlines website. The driver can receive flight status and time-to-leave notifications, get directions on how to get to the airport, and find the best place to meet the traveler.</p></div><div class="section"><h2>Process</h2><p><strong>My process included a user flow, sketches, and a prototype.</strong> From the project concept, I began by creating a user flow. I then sketched ideas for what the features in the user flow would look like and created a simple design system. With components from the design system, I created an interactive prototype in Figma.</p></div><div class="section"><h2>My Role</h2><p><strong>I completed the entirety of this project myself.</strong></p></div><div class="section section-wide"><div class="row align-items-center"><div class="col-md image-margins text-center"><figure class="figure my-0"><a data-fancybox="lightbox_showcase" data-caption="Pick-Up Assistant: driver view" data-width="375" href="/assets/images/projects/airport/showcase_1.png"><img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="/assets/images/projects/airport/showcase_1.png" width="375" alt=""></a><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Pick-Up Assistant: driver view</figcaption></figure></div><div class="col-md image-margins text-center"><figure class="figure my-0"><a data-fancybox="lightbox_showcase" data-caption="Pick-Up Assistant: traveler view" data-width="375" href="/assets/images/projects/airport/showcase_2.png"><img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="/assets/images/projects/airport/showcase_2.png" width="375" alt=""></a><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Pick-Up Assistant: traveler view</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class="section text-center"><p><a class="btn btn-lg btn-secondary" href="#mockup">Skip to Mockup <span class="iconify" data-icon="feather:arrow-down"></span></a></p></div><div class="section-tall"><hr></div><div class="section-tall"><h1>Process</h1><div class="timeline-row"><div class="timeline-col"><a href="#research"><img src="/assets/images/projects/airport/research.svg" alt=""><p>Research</p></a></div><div class="timeline-col"><a href="#sketches"><img src="/assets/images/projects/airport/sketches.svg" alt=""><p>Sketches and Wireframes</p></a></div><div class="timeline-col"><a href="#design"><img src="/assets/images/projects/airport/design.svg" alt=""><p>Design</p></a></div><div class="timeline-col"><a href="#prototype"><img src="/assets/images/projects/airport/prototype.svg" alt=""><p>Prototype</p></a></div></div><div class="section" id="research"><h2>Research</h2><div class="section image-margins-x text-center"><img class="illustration" src="/assets/images/projects/airport/research.svg" alt="Illustration of woman laying down, using laptop"></div><p>I got the idea for this project when I was picking a friend up from the airport. I realized that, even as an air travel aficionado, I could not think of a single app designed to streamline the pick-up experience for a driver. I enjoy a trip to the airport—seeing a variety of planes from faraway places—but the average person does not.</p><div class="lead"><p>For many people, a trip to the airport is an unfamiliar, complicated experience. A solution to manage the seeming chaos would be quite valuable to the infrequent airport visitor.</p></div><p>I initially planned on designing a separate app for drivers to receive flight updates and information. As I thought through the target user, who does not go to the airport often, and why they might download such an app, however, I realized that this solution would not be practical. Requiring an app download for onboarding would likely deter a significant portion of potential users.</p><p>A set of features like this would likely be most successful as part of an existing airline’s website because the friction in the onboarding process could be reduced significantly. I chose Southwest Airlines because their target customer is budget-conscious—the kind of traveler who might get a ride to and from the airport from friends or family instead of paying for an Uber.</p></div><div class="section" id="sketches"><h2>Sketches and Wireframes</h2><div class="section image-margins-x text-center"><img class="illustration" src="/assets/images/projects/airport/sketches.svg" alt="Illustration of a woman sketching user interface elements"></div><div class="lead"><p>To begin solving the problem of a stressful airport experience, I created a simple user flow for an Airport Pick-Up Assistant feature.</p></div><p>The user flow follows them from the beginning of the interaction with the website to pick-up. This gave me an idea of what screens would need to be created as part of this feature. I sketched a potential design for a home screen for a standalone app before pivoting towards designing a solution within an airline website. I then sketched a design for each of the components that would make up the final design.</p><div class="section section-wide"><div class="row align-items-center"><div class="col-md image-margins text-center"><figure class="figure my-0"><a data-fancybox="lightbox_sketches" data-caption="User flow for Airport Pick-Up Assistant" data-width="1470" href="/assets/images/projects/airport/flow.jpg"><img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="/assets/images/projects/airport/flow.jpg" width="1470" alt=""></a><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">User flow for Airport Pick-Up Assistant</figcaption></figure></div><div class="col-md image-margins text-center"><figure class="figure my-0"><a data-fancybox="lightbox_sketches" data-caption="Sketches of a potential home screen" data-width="1470" href="/assets/images/projects/airport/sketches_1.jpg"><img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="/assets/images/projects/airport/sketches_1.jpg" width="1470" alt=""></a><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Sketches of a potential home screen</figcaption></figure></div><div class="col-md image-margins text-center"><figure class="figure my-0"><a data-fancybox="lightbox_sketches" data-caption="Sketches of user interface components" data-width="1470" href="/assets/images/projects/airport/sketches_2.jpg"><img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="/assets/images/projects/airport/sketches_2.jpg" width="1470" alt=""></a><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Sketches of user interface components</figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div class="section" id="design"><h2>Design</h2><div class="section image-margins-x text-center"><img class="illustration" src="/assets/images/projects/airport/design.svg" alt="Illustration of a man next to mobile app designs"></div><p>A number of the UI elements in the Pick-Up Assistant—especially in the flow to select the correct flights—exist already in the Southwest website. I didn’t want to reinvent the wheel. Southwest has a great brand already.</p><div class="lead"><p>I used relevant elements from Southwest’s website to maintain consistency with their existing design language.</p></div><p>I ran into a problem with these elements, however: the Southwest mobile website’s design itself is not very consistent. Font colors and sizes, element padding, corner radius, and alignment are not the same from one page to another. I addressed these issues in my new design.</p><div class="lead"><p>To introduce vertical rhythm into my design, I adjusted all element and font sizing and padding to follow an 8-point grid.</p></div><p>I also made UI elements much more consistent. In my design, whenever there’s a departure and arrival listed, the text for departure is aligned to the left and the text for arrival is to the right. There is always an icon representing the appropriate vehicle in between the departure and arrival times (except for when the times are intentionally de-emphasized, such as the scheduled times for a flight that has been delayed). This applies to flights as well as other transportation, like the car ride to the airport.</p><p>Even with my changes to existing UI elements, they still retain most of the original design and stay true to Southwest’s identity.</p><div class="section section-wide"><div class="row align-items-center"><div class="col-md image-margins text-center"><figure class="figure my-0"><a data-fancybox="lightbox_design" data-caption="Before: flight information screen while boarding" data-width="375" href="/assets/images/projects/airport/flyer_info_before.png"><img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="/assets/images/projects/airport/flyer_info_before.png" width="375" alt=""></a><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Before: flight information screen while boarding</figcaption></figure></div><div class="col-md image-margins text-center"><figure class="figure my-0"><a data-fancybox="lightbox_design" data-caption="After: flight information screen while boarding" data-width="375" href="/assets/images/projects/airport/flyer_info_after.png"><img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="/assets/images/projects/airport/flyer_info_after.png" width="375" alt=""></a><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">After: flight information screen while boarding</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class="section section-wide"><div class="row align-items-center"><div class="col-md image-margins text-center"><figure class="figure my-0"><a data-fancybox="lightbox_design" data-caption="User flow for Airport Pick-Up Assistant" data-width="375" href="/assets/images/projects/airport/status_before.png"><img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="/assets/images/projects/airport/status_before.png" width="375" alt=""></a><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">User flow for Airport Pick-Up Assistant</figcaption></figure></div><div class="col-md image-margins text-center"><figure class="figure my-0"><a data-fancybox="lightbox_design" data-caption="Sketches of a potential home screen" data-width="375" href="/assets/images/projects/airport/status_after.png"><img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="/assets/images/projects/airport/status_after.png" width="375" alt=""></a><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Sketches of a potential home screen</figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div class="section" id="prototype"><h2>Prototype</h2><div class="section image-margins-x text-center"><img class="illustration" src="/assets/images/projects/airport/prototype.svg" alt="Illustration of a man standing next to a mobile phone"></div><div class="lead"><p>With the user flow, I created mockups of each of this feature’s screens, making them interactive using Figma.</p></div><p>The driver view begins on the search screen, where the user finds and selects the correct flight.
