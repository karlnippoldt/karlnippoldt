_“I’m going to leave you behind!”_ my step-dad shouted.

_Whatever happened to “No man is left behind?”,_ I thought to myself. _2 miles. Are you kidding me, at 8-minute-mile pace?_ My lungs were on fire, and I was horribly out of shape. Somehow, I survived the loop around the neighborhood. For the first time in a very long time, I was mentally drained and physically exhausted.

What motivated and pushed me? Well, obviously my step-dad yelling at me, but I could have just quit and ignored his teasing while I sat on my bed and answered the call to duty by saving the world on my Xbox. I wasn’t going to give up that easy, though. I was going to show my step-dad that I wasn’t just a lazy kid that played video games all day (and at the time I was). Instead, I accepted the challenge and went all in.

At the finish, I was overwhelmed by a sense of accomplishment. I hadn’t even run a race and it took me 16 minutes to run only 2 miles, but I felt like I was in the Olympics. The feeling of accomplishing something that really required my all was awesome, better than beating any level of some game on my Xbox. I loved the challenge and the feeling of being mentally and physically tough enough to run 2 miles.

2 years later, I still run for the challenge, loving it when people tell me I’m crazy. I didn’t stop there; I kept challenging myself to see what I could do. I joined the cross-country team and the track team, and no matter how fast or slow I run, as long as I know I gave everything I had, I’m satisfied.

Running for 2 years now, I’ve had my fair share of mental battles during races and hard workouts, some won and some lost, but I keep myself motivated by remembering the feeling of accomplishment after beating my goal and by knowing that I need to stay mentally tough.

The desire to challenge myself didn’t stop at running. It eventually transferred into all the other parts of my life, too: my grades improved, and I started to think more and more about college. Now, no matter how bad I feel during a run or how slow I go, I can remember that I’m running circles around all the couch potatoes and kids playing video games all day.

So before you think about throwing in the towel and think it’s too late or you’re too tired, remember why you run. It definitely takes a special type of person to be a runner and even a bit of crazy, but just remember that you can be mentally and physically tough.
