description: I created a basic electronic medical records interface for use by doctors and nurses in a hospital setting for a one-week design exercise. I interviewed a registered nurse to learn more about processes and special considerations in a hospital setting, then created a clickable high-fidelity mockup with Figma based on the exercise requirements and the interview.
