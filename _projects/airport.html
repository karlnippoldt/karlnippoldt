title: Airport Pick-Up Assistant Concept

description: Many people are overwhelmed and stressed when they are picking up friends and family at an airport. Inspired by my own trip to the airport, I realized that many travel apps cater to the travelerâ€”but few to people who would pick them up. I created a way for people to be better informed of flight status, how to get to the airport, advantageous rendezvous spots, and more. Since many of these people only go to the airport occasionally and would likely not want to download an app for infrequent use, this concept is primarily designed as an addition to the existing Southwest mobile website.
